Hi! I'm Evelyn. Welcome to 🍵 **Maccha Koubou / 抹茶工房** – the workshop of gentle ideas and warm designs!

From digital services to physical spaces, I believe design can connect technology, society, and people. Through thoughtful, empathetic practice, I aim to respond to complex and systemic challenges with inclusion and connection.

- 🏳️‍🌈 **Queer & Feminism** - I focus on how vulnerability is unequally distributed through intersectional power structures, and work towards fostering practices of mutual care and connection.

- ♿️ **Anti-Ableism** - I see disability as shaped by social and systemic barriers, and focus on accessible and enabling design for people with diverse access needs.
